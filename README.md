# Vaccinations-Tracking-Part-2-OOP

# Vaccination Tracker - Object-Oriented Programming

## Project Overview
This project, developed in Python, is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) solution for managing vaccination records. It demonstrates the application of OOP principles such as class creation, object instantiation, encapsulation, and method implementation.

### Key Features
- **Class Design:** Implementation of classes like `Person` and `VaccinationRecord` to model real-world entities.
- **Data Management:** Efficient management of individual vaccination records and aggregate data.
- **User Interaction:** Interactive console-based interface for inputting and retrieving vaccination data.

## How to Run
This section guides you through setting up and running the Vaccination Tracker project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x (Download and install from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/))

### Installation
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - First, clone this repository to your local machine using:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/angelinedorvil/Vaccinations-Tracking-Part-2-OOP
     ```
   - If you don't have Git installed, you can download and unzip the source code from GitHub.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   - After cloning, navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd vaccinations-tracking-part-2-oop
     ```

### Running the Application
